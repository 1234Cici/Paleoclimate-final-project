# Paleoclimate-final-project
For the purpose of paleoclimate final project: data and codes for Bahia Almirante project (2020-2021)

Raw_d18O: contains d18O measurements from Picarro

Raw_salinity: contains salinity measurements from refractometer

Corrected_d18O: contains d18O data after memory and drift corrections

Final_data: contains merged datasets with useful information including corrected d18O, SSS anomalies, SST anomalies and date

Panama_isotope_salinity.Rmd: merging isotope data with salinity measurements

Paleoclimate_final.Rmd: merging SST and SSS anomalies to the sheet and subsetting into six datasets according to sample locations 

Correction_script.ipynb: correcting d18O measurements for memory and drift effects. Written by Dr. Will Larsen, modified by Weidai Sun

Final_coral.ipynb: coral proxy system modeling for simulating coral d18O. Sensor model developed by Dr. Sylvia Dee, modified by Weidai Sun.
